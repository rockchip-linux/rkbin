1. modify "ddrbin_param.txt", choose ddr frequency, uart info.
2. run "ddrbin_tool" with argument 1: ddrbin_param.txt, argument 2: ddr bin file.
   like: ./ddrbin_tool ddrbin_param.txt px30_ddr_333MHz_v1.13.bin

ddrbin_param.txt:
start tag: keep default value. Do not modify it.
ddr2_freq: ddr2 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp2_freq: lpddr2 frequency,  unit:MHz.
ddr3_freq: ddr3 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp3_freq: lpddr3 frequency,  unit:MHz.
ddr4_freq: ddr4 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp4_freq: lpddr4 frequency,  unit:MHz.

If ddr*_freq/lp*_freq is no value, it's frequency will keep the same with the ddr bin frequency.

uart id：uart number. 0 for uart0, 1 for uart1, 2 for uart2..., 0xf will disable uart.
uart iomux：uart iomux info, 0 for uartn_m0, 1 for uartn_m1, 2 for uartn_m2...(like uart2_m0, uart2_m1,uart2_m2),
Or 1 for uartn_a, 2 for uartn_b, 3 for uartn_c.(like uar2a, uart2b, uart2c).
uart baudrate：uart baudrate should be 115200 or 1500000.

If uart id/iomux/baudrate is no value, uart info will keep the same with ddr bin config.

ddr_2t: ddr 2T timing mode. 1: enable ddr 2T, 0: disable ddr 2T.
If 'ddr_2t' is no value, ddr_2t info will keep the same with ddr bin config.
